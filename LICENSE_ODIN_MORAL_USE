ODIN Moral Use Clause (v1.0)

In addition to the terms above, the following condition applies:

This software may not be used to knowingly:

- Spread misinformation or disinformation
- Enable surveillance, profiling, or exploitation of individuals or groups
- Support extractive influence operations or psyops
- Aid in the suppression of knowledge, freedom, or human rights
- Be deployed in service of systems that deny people the ability to learn, question, dissent, or access truth

The spirit of this clause is to preserve the integrity of tools built under the ODIN networkâ€”tools meant for education, transparency, collective growth, and the empowerment of communities, not their manipulation.

Violation of this clause is not merely a legal issue. It is a violation of the trust and values embedded in this software.

If you're unsure whether your use case qualifies, ask the community. We are building this together.
