# ODIN: Rhymes

_A decentralized tool for listening to language like it shapes the future-because it does._

---

## What Is Rhymes?

ODIN: Rhymes is an open-source, modular system designed to help communities **trace the origins, impacts, and futures of the language we use.**

It's a framework for:

- Mapping how ideas "rhyme" across history and culture
- Analyzing the ripple effects of powerful phrases or narratives
- Offering reframes grounded in ethics, clarity, and collective wisdom

> **"History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes."**  
> -Mark Twain (probably)

## What It Does

- **Voice Synthesizer**: Blend iconic communicator styles (e.g., Sagan, Greta, Morrison) to shape more effective, emotionally resonant messages
- **Echo Tracker**: Trace phrases to their ideological roots and follow their evolution across media, culture, and history
- **Reframe Engine**: Generate thoughtful, responsible alternative framings for harmful, misleading, or polarizing statements
- **Signal Archive**: A scroll-based knowledge system for documenting influential phrases and their trajectories

## Why It Matters

Misinformation travels faster than reflection.  
We're building Rhymes to:

- Protect language from weaponisation
- Support public thinkers, educators, and builders
- Teach young people to hear and speak with care
- Create tools for collective memory and media literacy

---

## Tech Stack (proposed)

- Frontend: SvelteKit / React
- Backend: Node.js / Holochain (agent-centric architecture)
- NLP: HuggingFace Transformers, Sentence-BERT
- Database: Neo4j (for graph mapping) + IPFS for decentralization
- Optional: GPT-based rephrasing with transparency controls

---

## Who This Is For

- Humans passionate about truth
- Engineers who care about truth, trust, and transparency
- Writers and educators who want tools to think out loud, together
- Students learning to question what they hear-and how they respond
- Communities building alternatives to centralised knowledge systems
